Slides and exercises for Numerical Methods I.
You can find here the slides I used for the course Numerical Methods I, as well as the exercises I proposed to my students. I taught it in the fall of 2023 and I was only in charged of the second half of the course. The computer hours were not my responsability, which is why there is no computer practice. However, to improve the computer skills the main activity I can suggest is programming each of the methods of the slide.
